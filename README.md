Social seating app
Next Generation For Airline Seating
Give people a chance to connect and control their seatmates before a flight, in-flight and afterwards.

How it works - Once a traveler books their flight, seatcheck-in users can login, view other public seatcheck-in user profiles then successfully negotiate seat swaps by offering other passengers to pay to change their seat. This can be done with or without the preferred seatmate’s knowledge. Upgrades offer during and after-flight/layover connectivity, messaging, resume’ sharing, social media networking and destination “things-to-do” options with incentive coupons.
